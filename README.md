# aniwatchAPI-Daemon
a small daemon and client for ghoshRitesh12's aniwatch API
Written entirely in Python b/c I'm too lazy to figure out C++ and memory management

Some documentation found at /Documentation/!-Home (foundout that Github isnt compatable with Obsidian links)

I made the project and then decided to upload to Github (hence the sudden content popup)

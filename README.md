# aniwatchAPI-Daemon
a small daemon and client for ghoshRitesh12's aniwatch API
Written entirely in Python b/c I'm too lazy to figure out C++ and memory management

Some documentation found at /Documentation/!-Home (foundout that Github isnt compatable with Obsidian links)

I made the project and then decided to upload to Github (hence the sudden content popup)

For reasons I wont link my own API that I use (I dont want to get DDOS'd or Dox'd)
For setting up your own API, you will need to setup ghoshRitesh12's version 2 API (https://github.com/ghoshRitesh12/aniwatch-api)
the server will need to be defined in the config (by default its None) (the config is made at first runtime)
